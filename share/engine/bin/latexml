# Hack, to make docutils use pandoc instead of latexml
# Pandoc works better than the main docutils latexml integration:
# - it automatically loads common packages like amsfonts; docutils only loads amsmath
# - it generates only one <math> element; latexml can generate multiple, but docutils only takes the first one
# Tested with docutils 0.19
# TODO: delete this after https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/patches/197/
exec pandoc --mathml -f latex -t html5
